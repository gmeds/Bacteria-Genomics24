## Course Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to bacterial genomics analysis using AWS cloud computing resources. Through lectures and hands-on labs, students will learn how to assemble, annotate, and analyze bacterial genomes. Key topics include:

- Basics of bacterial genomics and whole genome sequencing
- Setting up cloud computing environments on AWS
- Genome assembly (short and long reads)
- Read mapping
- Genome annotation
- Variant calling
- Variant annotation and effect analysis
- Antimicrobial resistance gene analysis
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Taxonomic analysis
- Gene set completeness analysis

By the end of the course, students will have experience performing common genomic analyses on bacterial sequence data using cloud resources. Course Modules
