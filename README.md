## Course Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to bacterial genomics analysis using AWS cloud computing resources. Through lectures and hands-on labs, students will learn how to assemble, annotate, and analyze bacterial genomes. Key topics include:

- Basics of bacterial genomics and whole genome sequencing
- Setting up cloud computing environments on AWS
- Genome assembly (short and long reads)
- Read mapping
- Genome annotation
- Variant calling
- Variant annotation and effect analysis
- Antimicrobial resistance gene analysis
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Taxonomic analysis
- Gene set completeness analysis

**Note: This course is continuously being updated. By the time you are here, some or most of the modules will not have beeen complete. However, the available material is just sufficient to get you started. Or when complete, the material will be constantly adjusted at no inconvenience.**

By the end of the course, students will have experience performing common genomic analyses on bacterial sequence data using cloud resources. Course Modules
